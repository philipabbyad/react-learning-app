## Features

- **Hello World**: The foundational "Hello World" component to begin your React journey.
- **Greeting Component (Props)**: Learn how to pass and use props in a functional component.
- **Counter Component (State)**: Understand how to manage component state using the `useState` hook.
- **Clear Documentation**: Easy-to-follow instructions for setup, running, and testing the app locally.
- **Comprehensive Tests**: Included unit tests ensure components work as expected and maintain code quality.
- **Modular Architecture**: The codebase is organized into separate files and folders for clarity and maintainability.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 14 or above)  
  [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/)

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-react-learning-app.git
cd my-react-learning-app
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
npm install
```
## Running the Application

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
yarn start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application. Any changes you make to the source code will automatically refresh the page.

## Testing

Run unit tests:

```bash
npm test
```

or

```bash
yarn test
```

The tests run in watch mode by default. Press q to quit watch mode.
These tests are powered by Jest and React Testing Library, ensuring components behave as expected.

## Building for Production

npm run build
```

or

```bash
yarn build
```

This command creates a production-ready build in the build directory. The output includes minified and optimized JavaScript and other assets, ready for deployment.
