# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is to define the functional and non-functional requirements for a web application designed to help users learn how to use React. This document will also serve as a prompt for generative AI to aid in the software development process.

### 1.2 Scope

The application will be a web-based learning platform written in JavaScript using React. It will initially implement a simple "Hello World" feature as a foundational starting point. Future iterations will expand upon this base to introduce advanced features and functionality. The application will include comprehensive documentation and unit tests to ensure it is both user-friendly and maintainable.

### 1.3 Audience

- **Primary Audience:** Software developers and learners interested in React.
- **Secondary Audience:** Generative AI tools aiding in development. These tools are expected to contribute by generating starter code, providing suggestions for improving code quality, automating documentation, and creating unit tests.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Core Features

#### 2.1.1 "Hello World" Application

- Display a simple "Hello World" message on the screen using React components.

#### 2.1.2 React Fundamentals Demonstration

- Showcase basic React concepts, including:
  - JSX syntax.
  - Functional components.
  - Props and state management.
  - Code base should include descriptive comments that explain all steps of the code

#### 2.1.3 Documentation

- Include a **comprehensive guide** for:
  - Setting up the local development environment, tailored to beginners with no prior experience in development.
  - Running the application locally.
  - Overview of the application structure and React fundamentals.

#### 2.1.4 Unit Tests

- Comprehensive unit tests using a React-compatible testing library (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library) to ensure functionality and code reliability.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Usability

- Ensure the application has a clear and intuitive user interface for learners.

### 3.2 Maintainability

- Use modular and well-documented code.
- Adhere to React best practices.

### 3.3 Performance

- Optimize the application to load quickly, even on minimal hardware configurations.

### 3.4 Compatibility

- Ensure the application runs on major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## 4. Development and Deployment Guidelines

### 4.1 Development Environment

- Use **Node.js** for the runtime environment.
- Include a package.json file to manage dependencies.
- Use a version control system (e.g., Git) with a clear branching strategy.

### 4.2 Local Setup Instructions

- Provide a step-by-step guide:
  - Installing Node.js.
  - Cloning the repository.
  - Running `npm install` to install dependencies.
  - Running `npm start` to launch the development server.

### 4.3 Testing Instructions

- Provide instructions for running unit tests locally using a testing library such as Jest or React Testing Library.

### 4.4 Deployment Instructions

- Document deployment steps for hosting the application on a platform like **Netlify**, **Vercel**, or **GitHub Pages**. Provide a brief comparison of these platforms, highlighting their key features, ease of use, and suitability for different types of projects.

## 5. Future Enhancements

- Introduce advanced React features (e.g., hooks, context, custom components).
- Add interactive tutorials or challenges for learners.
- Include integration with external APIs to demonstrate real-world React applications.
